# [AI-Powered Medical Scribing App](https://aiscribe.fly.dev)
This application is an AI-powered medical scribing tool that records doctor–patient conversations and automatically generates the History (Hx) and Physical Exam (PE) sections of a clinical note. It uses a normal negative PE template and updates it by inserting any abnormal findings mentioned during the conversation while removing or adjusting contradictory statements. If no findings are stated, the default template is used. The app focuses on producing an accurate History section, which is the most valuable part for physicians, while also ensuring patient privacy by removing any personal details from the final output. To improve transcription quality, the system supports medical vocabulary handling so that clinical terms are recognized and documented correctly.
